### Question
Which toxic metabolite accumulates after acute paracetamol overdose?
### Answer
NAPQI
### Choice
Glutathione
### Choice
Glucoronyl groups
### Choice
N-acetyl cysteine
### Choice
Acetaminophen
### Explanation
Paracetamol is metabolized in the liver.

In the setting of acute overdose, **liver conjugation** (Phase 2 reaction) **is overloaded** leading to paracetamol being metabolized by an alternative pathway.

This alternative pathway leads to a toxic- metabolite: **NAPQI** (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine).

This is usually **inactivated by glutathione**.

If the paracetamol overdose is severe, glutathione is depleted leading to accumulation of NAPQI and subsquent necrosis of liver and kidney tissue.

*Acetaminophen* is another name for *paracetamol*. 

Glucoronyl is an example of a chemical group added onto a drug during conjugation.

N-acetyl cysteine is used to treat paracetamol overdose to replenish glutathione levels.
